# Overview
### Category
- Description of a research prototype

### Context
- Theoretical bases
  - word2vec
  - tf-idf

Correctness
- ???

Contributions
- A novel model, separate embeddings for query words and documents words, jointly based on an unlabeled corpus
- Document ranking scheme (query is also a document), which is equivalent to comparing query word embeddings to centroid of document word embeddings
- Compare the novel approach with the traditional word counting feature approach
